# Minimal Docker

Running experiments in trying to create as small a Docker container as possible for a Java hello world app.

The application itself is absolutely minimal to highlight the differences between the various methods of Dockerization. Note that the resulting jar file is only 2.5 kB.

| Dockerfile   | Image size | Description                                  |
| ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Dockerfile.1 | 521 MB     | Na√Øve: build and distribute the same image   |
| Dockerfile.2 | 436 MB     | Multi-stage: separate build and distribution |
| Dockerfile.3 | 202 MB     | Multi-stage, but with a minimal base image   |
| Dockerfile.4 | 115 MB     | JLink to reduce JRE size                     |
| Dockerfile.5 | 89 MB      | GraalVM native image; no JDK needed at all   |
| Dockerfile.6 | 16 MB      | GraalVM native image; no Linux needed either |
